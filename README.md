- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mario
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything STEM! Physics, Computers etc
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing Computer Science in the AI/ML stream, with a minor in Mathematics

Here I post my most interesting projects I wish to showcase. Most projects have google drive links, or a .mp4 file to download titled "showcase" 
to show a quick summary of the project.
